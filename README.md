# suggestionapp
This is more of a usage of an API than an actual app. But is has interface, styling, functionality and stuff.
You might consider as a part of an app.

I have used the TMDb API in for a practical approach basically just to learn more.

Main functionality is a search based on the genre or genres of movies that the user might be interested in. 
The user get all the movies with the specified genre/s and also the poster of the movies with a truncated overview. 
Aaaand that's all.
